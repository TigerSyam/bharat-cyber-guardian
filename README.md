# Bharat Cyber Guardian

Bharat Cyber Guardian is an AI-powered **Digital Safety Tutor** designed to protect vulnerable and first-time internet users in India from cyber scams.

Unlike traditional scam detection tools that only block or flag messages, Bharat Cyber Guardian focuses on **explainable and teaching-oriented AI**. The system not only detects fraudulent messages but also explains scam mechanisms and educates users on safe digital behavior, helping users build long-term digital immunity.

## Problem Context

- LLM-powered personalized explanation and teaching

The system is privacy-first, consent-based, and designed for multilingual and low-bandwidth environments.
